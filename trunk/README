edukapp widget store
(http://code.google.com/p/edukapp)
-----

Before you start:

1. Create a new local MySQL database called "edukapptest" (username and password the same)
2. Run the "edukapptests_06_02.sql" query to setup the tables

To start:

mvn install
mvn cargo:start

This will start the following web applications:

1. The Edukapp web application at localhost:8080
2. An Apache Wookie widget server at localhost:8080/wookie
3. An Apache Solr search engine server at localhost:8080/solr

To add the widget metadata from Wookie into the Solr search engine:

http://localhost:8080/solr/en/dataimport?command=full-import

To search widgets:

http://localhost:8080/search?q=chat

To find widgets that are similar to a specific widget:

http://localhost:8080/similar?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwookie.apache.org%2Fwidgets%2Fsimplechat

To get reviews for a widget:

http://localhost:8080/review?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwookie.apache.org%2Fwidgets%2Fsimplechat

TODO

1. Set up Shindig automatically 

====

Assumptions: 
1. 	there is a wookie (http://incubator.apache.org/wookie/)
2. 	and shindig (http://shindig.apache.org/) service running in parallel
	need to declare their locations in build.properties
	in future integrate distribution war files and deploy all three components together through the ant script 	

3. 	application server: for now app is developed and tested in tomcat v.7
	in future offer support for other popular application servers (jboss,glassfish,..)

4. 	JPA: we use openJPA (http://openjpa.apache.org/) implementation of jpa
	support hibernate,eclipselink,toplink?
	
5. 	database: for now app is dev and tested in mysql
	shall be trivial to port in other dbms - 
	in future use apache torque to offer multiple db engines
	
	todo: include database schema(connection URL),db user and pass in build.properties
